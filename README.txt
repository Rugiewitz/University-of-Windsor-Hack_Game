Hello, 
I hope you're having fun when playing my game.
Few things here, 
FIRST- remember to play the game in "Windowed" mode so you are able to exit it
SECOND- there might be a rare occurance of a bug, remember this is a demo.
THIRD-The leader of this group is Darko Atanackovic of the university of windsor
FOURTH- this should have been number one, but make sure all the files are in the same folder/directory or it won't work.

Controls!
Forward = W
Jump = Space
turning character left/right = A/D


Hope you guys have fun. It's about 250mb game because of all the models, music, and scripts that are inside it. Models are really heavy and weights alot~ (this is a joke, take no offense to it)
